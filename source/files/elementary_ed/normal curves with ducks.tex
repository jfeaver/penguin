\begin{enumerate}

\item 20,000 ducks were surveyed and asked how many miles they swam over the course of the month of June. The average was 800 miles and the standard deviation was 15 miles. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Draw a normal curve, with percentages, the mean and the standard deviations marked on it for this data.

\vspace{2in}

\item How many of the ducks swam somewhere between 800 and 815 miles in June?
